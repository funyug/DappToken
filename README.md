#Dapp Token Contract
Two demo contracts to simulate an ico crowdsale. DappToken.sol contains code for a token named Dapp Token. DappTokenSale.sol contains code for contract that allows people to buy the Dapp Token for 0.001 ETH per token.

#Run
* Run `npm run dev` to run the crowsale website server.
* Use the rinkeby testnet coins to buy tokens via the website. 

Note: Contract is deployed on the rinkeby network.
